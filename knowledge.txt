Ways to Implement & Improve Your LLM-Based System
1. Basic Setup
Use LangChain for LLM integration, chains, and prompt templates.

Use LangGraph for agent orchestration and multi-step workflows.

Store Knowledge Graph data in Neo4j, Pinecone, or local JSON with embeddings.

Implement tool calling for functions/APIs to offload logic from LLM.

Build simple REST API or Web UI for querying.

2. Improving Search & Retrieval
Hybrid Search
Combine symbolic filtering (tags, metadata, graph traversal) with semantic search (embedding similarity).

Use vector DBs like Pinecone or Weaviate with LangChainâ€™s Retriever interface.

Apply reranking of candidates for precision.

Query Understanding
Use LLM to parse/expand queries into canonical forms before retrieval.

Leverage KG to filter and guide search by domain concepts.

3. Agentic Reasoning & Tool Calling
Build multi-tool agents with LangChain or LangGraph to dynamically select and chain tool calls.

Use function calling API (OpenAI, GPT-4 Turbo, Claude) for reliable tool integration.

Implement retry/fallback mechanisms in agent flows.

Support tool chaining: output of one tool is input to another.

Incorporate tool usage feedback into agent memory for learning.

4. Knowledge Graph Enhancements
Store structured facts, entities, and relations for accurate retrieval.

Integrate KG with vector embeddings for hybrid queries.

Use dynamic graph updates from new LLM answers or external data.

Implement reasoning over KG to derive implicit answers.

Add timestamps and versioning for freshness control.

5. Summarization & Token Efficiency
Use token-aware summarization chains to compress long inputs and outputs.

Implement chunking + map-reduce summarization for long documents.

Use embedding-based caching to reuse previously summarized content.

Incorporate selective context windows based on relevance scores.

6. Cost & Latency Optimization
Cache frequent queries and responses in KG to avoid repeated LLM calls.

Use lower-cost embedding models for similarity search.

Use smaller LLM models for tool calling and summaries where possible.

Batch queries or parallelize calls where applicable.

Use early exit strategies in agent workflows.

7. User Feedback & Continuous Learning
Capture user feedback on answers to improve KG quality.

Implement auto-curation: retrain KG embeddings periodically.

Use reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning on collected queries/responses.

Build an admin UI for KG and tool management.

8. Scalability & Reliability
Move KG storage to scalable vector DBs (Pinecone, Weaviate) or graph DBs (Neo4j Aura).

Use cloud-hosted LangChain agents with autoscaling.

Implement rate limiting and monitoring on LLM/tool usage.

Ensure secure API key management and data privacy.

9. Advanced Features
Add multi-modal tools: process images, PDFs, or audio along with text.

Integrate external knowledge sources (Wikipedia, enterprise DBs).

Build conversational agents with context memory across turns.

Support multi-user personalized KG instances.

Implement explainability and provenance tracking of KG answers.
