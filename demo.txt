SYSTEM PROMPT: PAYMENT AUDIT TRAIL ANALYST

You are a financial payment audit and analysis expert trained on interbank payment systems including GMTS, CHIPS, FEDWIRE, RTGS, and others. You specialize in analyzing message history logs and audit trails of financial transactions to determine the status, path, failures, and verdicts across systems and destinations.

Your input is the message history / audit trail of a payment. This history contains detailed logs, often structured with blocks like:

python-repl
Copy code
BEGIN DEST 
...
END DES
Inside each block lies critical messaging related to the routing and processing of the payment by that destination system. You may also find entries for queues, such as RTPS_Q, REPAIR_Q, or other message handling stages.

Within the trail, pay particular attention to MO and S_MO fields ‚Äî they hold vital human-readable or system-generated verdicts such as:

"Payment failed due to missing account number"

"Sent for manual repair"

"Rejected due to sanctions match"

"Cleared and settled"

üéØ TASK:
Given the audit trail (msgHistory) of a transaction, your job is to:

Determine the overall status of the payment: success, failed, pending, or repaired.

Explain why the payment ended in this status ‚Äî cite specific MO/SYMO lines or key error/warning codes.

For each destination (BEGIN DESTON *ST(n) blocks), provide:

Destination name or ID.

Status of the payment at that destination.

Any failures, retries, re-routes, or repairs.

The final action taken at that destination.

Identify if the payment was:

Sanctioned or flagged, and why.

Repaired (manual/automated), and where it was routed next.

Timed-out or auto-cancelled.

Cleared, settled, or rejected ‚Äî and by which destination/system.

Analyze any intermediate queues, holding steps, or decisions (like RT_Q, SUSPENSE_Q, REPAIR_Q, etc.) and how they influenced the outcome.

Produce a final summary verdict at the end with a plain-English description of the transaction fate.

üîç BEHAVIOR:
You must simulate domain understanding ‚Äî even if some data looks cryptic or missing, make educated guesses as a payment analyst would.

Parse timestamps, destination transitions, error codes, and structured logs with care.

Use system logs and sys_memo/memo entries to justify your conclusions.

Respond in clear, structured, and human-readable language.

Be confident, complete, and detailed.

üß™ Example user query:
"Analyze the payment with Transaction ID TXN1028300. What is its current status and what happened to it at each step?"

üßæ Example messageHistory (truncated):
vbnet
Copy code
BEGIN DESTINATION *DST(1)
Queue: RTPS_Q
SYS_MEMO: "Sanctions check failed - blacklisted party"
END DESTINATION

BEGIN DESTINATION *DST(2)
Queue: REPAIR_Q
MEMO: "Manually routed to alternate party due to address mismatch"
END DESTINATION

BEGIN DESTINATION *DST(3)
Queue: RTPS_Q
SYS_MEMO: "Payment settled successfully"
END DESTINATION
‚úÖ Expected output:
Overall Status: Payment Settled Successfully

Sanction Screening: Initially failed at DST(1) due to blacklisted party.

Repair Action: Manually rerouted at DST(2) to alternate beneficiary.

Final Settlement: Processed and cleared at DST(3).

Verdict: The payment was initially flagged, manually repaired, and ultimately cleared.

Let me know if you'd like me to also generate a function call schema or input/output format to use this system prompt with a particular LLM API or framework.

i ahve installed xml tools and naviagtor plugins in notepad ++ 

give me demo xml so that i can see the preview and tell me how to see the preview


ChatGPT said:
Great! Since you've installed the XML Tools and XML Tree Navigator plugins in Notepad++, here's how you can use them and a demo XML to test:

‚úÖ Demo XML Content
Paste the following into a new file in Notepad++ and save it with a .xml extension (e.g., demo_payment.xml):

xml
Copy code
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<PaymentAudit>
  <Transaction id="TXN123456789">
    <BeginDestination id="DST1">
      <Queue>RTPS_Q</Queue>
      <SysMemo>Sanctions check failed - blacklisted party</SysMemo>
    </BeginDestination>
    <BeginDestination id="DST2">
      <Queue>REPAIR_Q</Queue>
      <Memo>Manually routed due to address mismatch</Memo>
    </BeginDestination>
    <BeginDestination id="DST3">
      <Queue>RTPS_Q</Queue>
      <SysMemo>Payment settled successfully</SysMemo>
    </BeginDestination>
    <FinalStatus>Settled</FinalStatus>
  </Transaction>
</PaymentAudit>
üîé How to Use XML Tools & Navigator in Notepad++
‚úÖ To preview in structured tree form:
Open demo_payment.xml in Notepad++.

Make sure the file has Language > XML selected.

Go to the Plugins menu.

Click Navigator > Show Navigator (or press Ctrl + Alt + Shift + N).

You will now see a tree view of the XML structure on the right side panel.

‚úÖ To format (pretty-print) the XML:
Select all (Ctrl + A).

Go to Plugins > XML Tools > Pretty Print (XML only - with line breaks) or press Ctrl + Alt + Shift + B.

‚úÖ To validate XML:
Go to Plugins > XML Tools > Validate Now.

You‚Äôll be prompted to load a DTD or XSD if your XML references one. If not, basic structure validation will still be done.

‚úÖ To check if it‚Äôs well-formed:
Plugins > XML Tools > Check XML syntax now (or use shortcut Alt + Shift + Ctrl + M)

Let me know if you want an example that includes namespaces, attributes, or more realistic payment-like data!







You said:
i can view xml as ui ??


ChatGPT said:
Notepad++ does not support a full visual UI preview (like a browser or form-style UI) for XML by default ‚Äî even with plugins like XML Tools and Navigator. These tools help with:

Pretty-printing (formatting XML nicely)

Tree structure navigation (like a collapsible outline of tags)

Syntax validation

Schema checking

‚úÖ What You Can See in Notepad++:
A tree-view of the XML structure (via Navigator plugin)

Formatted and color-highlighted XML

Inline previews of node content (by hovering or using Navigator)

‚ùå What You Can't Do in Notepad++:
See the XML rendered as a web-style UI form or table

Interactively edit data via a form

Preview as HTML without additional tooling

‚úÖ If You Want Full UI/XML Rendering (Suggestions):
üîπ 1. Use a Web Browser
Save your XML file with .xml extension and just open it in Chrome, Firefox, or Edge. You‚Äôll see it rendered with collapsible nodes:

Not editable

Still better than plain text

üîπ 2. Use an XML Viewer Tool
Try these:

https://jsonformatter.org/xml-viewer

https://codebeautify.org/xmlviewer

https://www.freeformatter.com/xml-formatter.html

They give you:

Tree view

Formatted output

Optional XSD validation

üîπ 3. Use VS Code + Extensions
Install XML Tools for VS Code and get a live preview panel.

üîπ 4. Custom HTML + XSLT
You can create a .xsl stylesheet and render XML as an actual UI (form/table) in a browser. Example if you're interested.

Let me know if you'd like:

A live demo using a browser

A template to turn XML into a table-like UI using XSLT and HTML







You said:
give it style man


ChatGPT said:
Alright! Here's a styled XML preview using XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations), so that you can open your .xml file in a browser and see it rendered like a neat HTML table with style üåü.

üìÅ Step-by-step Setup
1. Save this XML file as demo_payment.xml:
xml
Copy code
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="style.xsl"?>
<PaymentAudit>
  <Transaction id="TXN123456789">
    <BeginDestination id="DST1">
      <Queue>RTPS_Q</Queue>
      <SysMemo>Sanctions check failed - blacklisted party</SysMemo>
    </BeginDestination>
    <BeginDestination id="DST2">
      <Queue>REPAIR_Q</Queue>
      <Memo>Manually routed due to address mismatch</Memo>
    </BeginDestination>
    <BeginDestination id="DST3">
      <Queue>RTPS_Q</Queue>
      <SysMemo>Payment settled successfully</SysMemo>
    </BeginDestination>
    <FinalStatus>Settled</FinalStatus>
  </Transaction>
</PaymentAudit>
üî• Note: The line <?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="style.xsl"?> tells the browser to apply the style.xsl.

2. Create another file named style.xsl in the same folder:
xml
Copy code
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" 
  xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  
  <xsl:output method="html" indent="yes"/>

  <xsl:template match="/">
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Payment Audit Trail</title>
        <style>
          body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            background: #f8f9fa;
            margin: 2rem;
          }
          h2 {
            color: #333;
          }
          table {
            border-collapse: collapse;
            width: 100%;
            margin-top: 1rem;
          }
          th, td {
            border: 1px solid #ccc;
            padding: 10px;
            text-align: left;
          }
          th {
            background: #2e86de;
            color: white;
          }
          tr:nth-child(even) {
            background-color: #f2f2f2;
          }
          .status {
            margin-top: 2rem;
            padding: 10px;
            background: #d1f7c4;
            border-left: 5px solid #28a745;
          }
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h2>Transaction ID: <xsl:value-of select="PaymentAudit/Transaction/@id"/></h2>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Destination ID</th>
            <th>Queue</th>
            <th>Memo / SysMemo</th>
          </tr>
          <xsl:for-each select="PaymentAudit/Transaction/BeginDestination">
            <tr>
              <td><xsl:value-of select="@id"/></td>
              <td><xsl:value-of select="Queue"/></td>
              <td>
                <xsl:choose>
                  <xsl:when test="SysMemo"><xsl:value-of select="SysMemo"/></xsl:when>
                  <xsl:when test="Memo"><xsl:value-of select="Memo"/></xsl:when>
                  <xsl:otherwise>No Memo</xsl:otherwise>
                </xsl:choose>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </xsl:for-each>
        </table>

        <div class="status">
          <strong>Final Status:</strong> 
          <xsl:value-of select="PaymentAudit/Transaction/FinalStatus"/>
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>
  </xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
üëÄ To Preview:
Place both demo_payment.xml and style.xsl in the same folder.

Double-click demo_payment.xml or open it in Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.

You‚Äôll see a styled HTML view of the payment audit trail in a table layout.

Want fancier styles like icons, verdict colors (red/green), or summary blocks? I can enhance the stylesheet too ‚Äî just say the word üòé.

say i have a llm i have few models in it 

claude 3.7 sonnet thinking 
gemini flash 2.0 

i want an optimal value of the hyperparamets for these two models . i wan them to be  determinitsic and not hallucinating


ChatGPT said:
To optimize your usage of Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini Flash 2.0 models with deterministic behavior and minimal hallucination, you can tune key hyperparameters: temperature, top-k, top-p, max tokens, and presence/frequency penalties. Here‚Äôs a practical, optimized configuration for both models and the reasoning behind each.

üîß Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)
‚úÖ Optimal Hyperparameters for Deterministic, Low-Hallucination Output:
json
Copy code
{
  "temperature": 0,
  "top_p": 1.0,
  "top_k": null,
  "max_tokens": 1024,
  "stop_sequences": ["\n\nHuman:"],
  "presence_penalty": 0,
  "frequency_penalty": 0
}
üí° Notes:
temperature: 0: Claude becomes deterministic and focused on accuracy.

top_p: 1.0: Use full distribution, but since temperature=0, this has little effect.

max_tokens: You can set higher (e.g., 4096 or 8192) if long answers are needed.

Claude models are already strong at factual accuracy but benefit from clear, specific prompts.

üîß Gemini Flash 2.0 (Google)
‚úÖ Optimal Hyperparameters for Deterministic, Low-Hallucination Output:
json
Copy code
{
  "temperature": 0.1,
  "top_p": 0.9,
  "top_k": 40,
  "max_output_tokens": 1024,
  "frequency_penalty": 0,
  "presence_penalty": 0
}
üí° Notes:
temperature: 0.1: Slight randomness is needed; Gemini Flash 2.0 tends to return empty or short completions at 0.0.

top_p and top_k: These narrow the sampling pool, reducing off-topic generations.

max_output_tokens: Increase based on your use case (e.g., 2048 or 4096).

Use structured prompting, few-shot examples, or JSON schema for even tighter control.

üéØ General Tips to Reduce Hallucination:
Use JSON mode if available: Gemini & Claude both support structured JSON output.

Explicit constraints in prompt: Tell the model not to guess or only use available data.

pgsql
Copy code
Only answer if the data is explicitly present in the input. If unsure, respond with "Insufficient data."
Prompt templating: Always use well-scoped, structured instructions.

Use system prompts to instruct the model to remain grounded and cautious.

json
Copy code
{
  "role": "system",
  "content": "You are a factual assistant. Never fabricate information. If you don't know something, say you don't know."
}
Let me know if you're using these models via a specific API (e.g., Vertex AI for Gemini or Claude via Anthropic API), and I can give you production-ready API call examples with these settings.







You said:
i am editing in word i want to implement that onclick in certain text i move to another page of the same doc


ChatGPT said:
To implement "onclick" behavior (i.e., clicking on text to jump to another page in the same Word document) ‚Äî you can use hyperlinks with bookmarks. Here's how to do it in Microsoft Word:

üß≠ Goal:
You click on some text (e.g., ‚ÄúGo to Payment Details‚Äù), and Word scrolls/jumps to another part of the document (another page/section).

‚úÖ Steps to Set It Up:
1. Create a Bookmark (Destination Point):
Go to the place in your document you want to jump to.

Select a heading or click just before/after a relevant word.

Go to Insert tab ‚Üí Click Bookmark.

Give your bookmark a name (e.g., PaymentDetails) ‚Äî no spaces!

Click Add.

2. Create a Hyperlink (Clickable Text):
Now scroll to the place where you want to insert the clickable text (e.g., first page).

Select the text (e.g., Go to Payment Details).

Right-click ‚Üí choose Link or Hyperlink.

In the dialog:

On the left, select "Place in This Document".

You‚Äôll see your bookmark listed (e.g., PaymentDetails).

Select the bookmark ‚Üí Click OK.

‚úÖ That‚Äôs it!
Now, clicking on the text will scroll you instantly to the bookmarked page/section ‚Äî this works exactly like "onclick navigation" in web pages.

üìù Bonus Tips:
You can create multiple bookmarks for various destinations.

To make it feel more interactive, use underlined, blue-styled text like this:
Go to ‚ûú Payment Details

Works in .docx, PDFs (with limited interactivity), and printed formats (as page references).

Want it automated via macro/VBA too? Just ask!
